# Local instance data (optional, but good practice if it shouldn't be in image)
# leaderboard.json 
# If you want a fresh leaderboard every time, or manage it via volumes in compose.
# For now, let's not explicitly ignore leaderboard.json as the Dockerfile doesn't copy it.
# If it were copied, ignoring it would prevent the local copy from overwriting the one in the image.
